Abusive Gym Reminder automatically keeps track of your gym attendance using GPS, and calls you a loser when you miss gym days.

## How it works

* **Find your gym** Use the placepicker to find your gym
* **Choose your gym days** You can change these anytime
* **Get Abused** If you dont go near your gym on a gym day, you'll receive an abusive notification the next morning

**Warning** Abusive Gym Reminder may contain offensive messages. You can adjust the abuse mode in the app.

## FAQ

* **GPS? Will this drain my battery?** No. The geofence does not require a persistent gps connection.

* **The app didn't register my visit!** Check if your GPS is enabled. You can also adjust gym radius in preferences. Unfortunately, location services can sometimes be inaccurate by nature. Please let me know if you can't get any gym visits at all. 

* **What if I live directly on top of my gym?** This app will not work correctly. But at least you have that going for you.
